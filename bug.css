This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with custom styles that include variables.  The variables might not be resolved correctly, leading to unexpected styles or rendering errors.  For example:

```css
:root {
  --my-color: blue;
}

.my-class {
  @apply bg-var(--my-color);
}
```

This might not apply `bg-blue` as expected.
